description: "The Wood Beyond the World is a fantasy novel by William Morris, perhaps\
  \ the first modern fantasy writer to unite an imaginary world with the element of\
  \ the supernatural, and thus the precursor of much of present-day fantasy literature.\
  \ It was first published in hardcover by Morris's Kelmscott Press, in 1894. The\
  \ book's importance in the history of fantasy literature was recognized by its republication\
  \ by Ballantine Books as the third volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy\
  \ series in July, 1969. The Ballantine edition includes an introduction by Lin Carter.\n\
